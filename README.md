## Proudest Profession Achievement
My proudest professional achievement is relatively recent. In October of last year a senior Software Engineer I had been
working closely with on several projects left for greener pastures. On his departure, I ended up taking over his position
on three of those projects. One project was coming up on a strict deadline and involved a system I had little experience on. 
I was able to learn the new system, bring another developer up to speed, resolve several complex bugs, add last minute features,
and complete documentation I had never written before, all within four months of taking over as the lead Software Engineer on the project.
I am proud of this achievement as it shows my resilience as a Software Engineer, my flexibility as an individual, and my potential as a leader.

## Recommendation For a Good Read
Before my phone screening I read the Scrum Reference Card (https://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/) to brush up on some scrum concepts.
I highly suggest this article to anyone that feels like they need a refresher on scrum. It also makes a great desk item for a scrum master that needs 
to make sure they are properly following all the steps. It breaks down the team, events, artifacts, and even goes into some practices, like XP,  that work well with scrum.
It contains everything you need to be an expert on scrum in a little under and hour. It even has a wonderful print version!

## Grandma: What does Availity do?
When you go to the doctor your medical needs there is a transfer of data that occurs between your insurance company and your doctor's office. 
It is important that this process happens effenciently but also accurately to make sure your medical bills are covered by your insurance. 
As the world has become more advanced, this transfer of data has become more complex, and a lot of wasted time and cost have been introduced over the years.
Availity is trying to created a streamlined one-stop-shop for your insurance company and doctor's office to communicate. This is important to you because the 
simplification of this process will help reduce the chances of a mistake happening, which could leave you with medical expenses you weren't expecting.
